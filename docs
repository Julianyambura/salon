The JavaScript -based Travel Planning Assistant

Core Functionalities as known

Before we begin to code, we must first list the functionalities of our travel planner in order to give it a structure.

User Input: Ask for user preferences (where they want to go, when they would like to do so, how much money is available, what are their interests and how many of them are going.).

Destination Data: Retrieve destination information from a database about tourist attractions, lodgings, vehicles operating there and weather conditions.

itinerary Generation: Make an itinerary adapted to user inputs based on available information.

Optimization: Optimize an itinerary by taking into account factors such as time needed for traveling, expenses and other customer preferences.

User Interface: Offer a user-friendly interface that can be used with the planner.
Offer guides if needed and provide a map to help the user
